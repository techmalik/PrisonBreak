# Analysis of Helicopter Escapes
This project aims to analyze helicopter prison breaks using Python. The dataset used for this project contains information about various helicopter escape incidents that have occurred in the past. The data is cleaned and processed using Python to extract relevant information such as the number of escapees, the type of helicopter used, and the success rate of the escape. The results of the analysis are then used to identify patterns and trends that can be used to inform security decisions.

Conclusion
By analyzing the data, the project aims to help security personnel identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve security measures and prevent future helicopter escape incidents. The results of the analysis can be used to inform security decisions such as helicopter type, security protocols, and escape prevention strategies.
